<h3>If you need an appointment at other times</h3>
<p>Call reception or <a href="https://leeds-city-medical.gpsurgery.net/">visit the surgery's website</a> to find out if appointments are available at other times (for example in the morning or late evening).</p>

<h3>Appointments at other surgeries</h3>
<p>Sometimes GP practices with more than one surgery allow patients to book appointments at any of their surgeries.</p>
<p>This surgery is part of the same practice as <a href="http://www.leeds-city-medical.gpsurgery.net">Leeds City Medical Practice</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>Call 111 if you want to speak to somebody about a health problem when the surgery isn’t open. Or you can <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/service-search">find other local NHS services</a> that might be able to help.</p> -->

  <!-- <h3>Appointments at another branch</h3>
  <p>Registered patients can book appointments at the practice’s other surgery: <a>Kenyon Medical Centres: Chace Avenue</a></p>

  <h3>Same-day appointments</h3>
  <p>Call reception at 8am Monday to Friday to see if a same-day appointment is available.</p>

  <h3>Early morning appointments</h3>
  <p>Book a week in advance for early morning appointments on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays, 7am to 7:50am</p> -->
